# Automation Tools to Reverse Engineering

In this repository, I will store my scripts that I create to automate some processes during some Reverse Engineering tasks.

Some scripts are just code exercises, the main topic of which is reverse engineering.

## Tools

For now, this repository contains the following tools:

- **hashdb_automated**: Yes, there are plugins for *Binary Ninja*, for *IDA Pro*, which already performs this action. However, thinking about Reverse Engineers who are still starting out, and cannot afford the pro version of *IDA* and *Binary Ninja* (and don't want to depend on ***Ghidra's terrible UI***), this script can save several hours when the analyst encounters **Hashed API** calls.
